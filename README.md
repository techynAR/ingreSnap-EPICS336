## Data Processing Pipeline üîÑ  

1. **Image Upload** ‚Üí **OCR Processing** ‚Üí **Text Extraction** ‚Üí **Analysis**  

**Steps Explained:**  
1. User uploads an image containing an ingredient list.  
2. Tesseract.js performs OCR to extract text from the image.  
3. Text processing utilities clean and parse the extracted text.  
4. Ingredients are matched with entries in the local database.  
5. Results are displayed with relevant safety, allergen, and nutritional information.
